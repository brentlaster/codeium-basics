# Codeium Basics - lab setup

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs. 
If you prefer and if you know one of the other IDEs supported by Copilot, you can use that. But the instructions will reference the codespace version.

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting the actual labs.

## 1. Create your own fork of the repository for these labs

- Ensure that you have created a repository by forking the [skillrepos/codeium-basics](https://github.com/skillrepos/codeium-basics) repository into your own GitHub area.
- You do this by navigating to the repo, clicking the `Fork` button in the upper right portion of the main project page and following the steps to create a copy in **your-github-userid/copilot-dd** .

## 3. Start your codespace

In your forked repository, start a new codespace.

- Click the `Code` button on your repository's landing page.
- Click the `Codespaces` tab.
- Click `Create codespace on main` to create the codespace.

**This will run for several minutes while it gets everything ready.**
  
- After the codespace has initialized there will be a terminal present.

This will take a while to run.

## 4. Open the labs

After the codespace has started, open the labs document by going to the file tree on the left, find the file named **labs.md**, right-click on it, and open it with the **Preview** option.)

This will open it up in a tab above your terminal. Then you can follow along with the steps in the labs. 
Any command in the gray boxes is either code intended to be run in the console or code to be updated in a file.
